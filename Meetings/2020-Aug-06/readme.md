### Notes
* Beth reviewed the positive results from .NET Conf: Focus on Microservices event (https://focus.dotnetconf.net) and talked about how we will work to bring in GitHub as a sponsor of the main event in November this year.
* Issac walked us through the new section of the website that displays the issues tagged "Help Wanted" as well as interviews with project maintainers. First interview is with CAKE
    * See: https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/get-involved
* We all discussed the design on the website and agreed it needs some help. We need to refresh the foundation's branding before we can tackle artwork but should start making UX/accessibility updates now. 
* Beth walked through how to send thank you gift codes to people (influencers, contributors, speakers, etc.) for the .NET engraved game box sets. There are about 30 left and we can work with Kotis to get more created. 
* Sara gave an update on the Wintellect training videos offer for our members valued at $199. We're waiting on the completion of Jeff Fritz's course to start advertising and handing out subscriptions. Beth to propose to the board the in-kind donation from Wintellect qualifies them to be included as a corporate sponsor. 
* Dee Dee walked through .NET Foundation Twitter sentiment analysis and found the general sentiment to be positive. While it was easy to focus on the negative sentiments from members of the open source community, the analysis proved that there was an equal amount of positive sentiment from Corporate members. The Committee agreed that based on this data, it was important that the Foundation does not overlook or exclude the Corporate members in an effort to please the open source community.
* Dee Dee proposed that the Corporate Sponsor membership to be divided into three levels. The levels would be called Premium Sponsorship, In-Kind Sponsorship, and Project Sponsorship. We need to flush this out in the public. Beth proposed to the incoming board that this should be a dedicated committee.  
* Beth proposed we look at refreshing our Marketing Committee goals for FY21. 

### Next Steps

* Isaac/Claire: start sourcing a UX designer for website
* Sara: Send committee co-marketing plan for Wintellect offer (done)
* Beth: Create sponsorbenefits.md in wg-marketing repo for public comment
