### Notes

- Went through [Marketing Committee repo](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing) and goals. 
- We need to finish up the [Marketing Proposals process](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/master/proposals.md) and start some templates. Templates should include Goals and Success Criteria. 
- Lots of discussion about student outreach. Introduced members to sync with @SaraJo and the Outreach committee
- Beth to create a repo for event sponsorship. @isaacrlevin to help with template and priortization. Mentioned @sfaatz might want to be involved here too since she started this last year. 
- Get a quarterly public meeting on the books where all committees present to the community.  @onovotny to discuss at next board meeting. 
- Didn't have time to go over .NET brand book. Beth to consider separate meeting for that.
