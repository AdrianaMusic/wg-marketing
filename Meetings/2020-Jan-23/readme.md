### .NET Foundation Marketing Goals

### Marketing activities
- Self-serve is the ultimate goal. We need to enable the membership to easily and frictionfree do these kinds of activities

### Goals for 2020
- Calendar – DD to own and update
- Membership – help partners evangelize .NET fdn to their customers

### Call for proposals to get budget (see slide 10)
- Beth to setup process for creating budget requests. Critical component for making a request is accountability – meaning the requestor needs to be on the hook for making sure the activity happens and also for reporting metrics.
- Beth will also put out a call for proposals

### Partnering with Outreach team. 
- Sara Chipps from the Outreach team joined the call and talked about areas that the marketing committee and outreach committee could work together including:
- Driving awareness
- Communicating together (attending each other’s meetings) so that we both know collaboration touch points
- Help membership understand how to contribute to open source

### .NET Trademark 
– progress is being made to move .NET trademark to .Net Fdn. Decision lies with CVP at MS
- Along with trademark, Beth is making progress on a brand book which will provide the basis and
boundaries for the foundation and its membership to use .NET branding

### Other business
- .NET Foundation board approved a fund injection by Microsoft that will enable a refresh of the .NET Foundation website including its information architecture.
- Finally, the .NET Foundation Marketing Committee will meet bi-weekly and Beth will send a meeting request.
