### Notes
Discussed candidate promotion via YouTube & Social for the upcoming election.  We need to make sure all our members are on the GitHub members team so we can easily communicate with them. Membership committee is making sure this is happening. Every member is now subscribed to the .NET Foundation newsletter. 

Discussed themes from the thread DeeDee started and what we can do to help: https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-foundation/teams/members/discussions/13. Areas discussed:
* Main issue: Transparency. 
    * Make sure we have a channel to communicate and have discussions (GitHub team)
    * Add all members to the newsletter (done)
    * More awareness about committees and programs on website
    * More promotion of activities & programs 
    * Make it easier for people to participate – create issues and use the “help wanted” tag
    * Publish the budget / finances
    * “State of the Union” regular updates from the Executive Director
    * Quarterly meeting to all members on the updates from the committees   
* Training
    * Provide free training to our members by working with training providers in exchange for co-marketing
    * Advertise [dotnet-presentations](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations) and encourage contributions from our members
* Project Benefits
    * We need to provide member project benefits more than just legal protection and infrastructure services. Explore how to  sponsor these better. i.e. Corporate sponsorships
    * Members feel like it's hard to contribute to projects. Projects committee could evaluate and recommend practices here during onboarding. i.e. "Help Wanted"
* Corporate Sponsor Relations
    * Corporate sponsor relations need to be improved. ED should be driving this, marketing needs to create pitch deck & promote benefits 
    * Corporate sponsors could choose which project and programs they want to sponsor specifically

### Help Wanted
We have a new section of the website Isaac has built that displays the issues tagged "Help Wanted". We will start creating more issues with this tag to help members participate more in specific tasks. Isaac will reach out to the projects committee to request member project participation. 
* See: https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/get-involved

Some areas we still need help with:
*  [Marketing Proposals process](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/issues/3) Templates should include Goals and Success Criteria.
*  [Events](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/events/issues/4) readme and sponsorship request issue templates. 
* "Event in a box" type of content for best practices on running online events and representing .NET Foundation. 

### Nomination to Committee
* If someone want to take on a job above and become a member of the committee, nominate yourself in the [marketing team discussion](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-foundation/teams/marketing).
