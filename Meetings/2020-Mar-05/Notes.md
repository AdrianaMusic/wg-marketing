### Notes
* Walked through Access Groups and Information Architecture for the Marketing Committee. Going forward the marketing team on GitHub will be the *committee members only*.
* Any member of the org can still participate in any team public discussion so we can still have good connection with our members [see GitHub teams help](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams#team-visibility). This is more for having only the *active* committee members and chair in a group that has maintainer access to the marketing related repos. 
* Update on the [Marketing Proposals process](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/master/proposals.md) and solicited help on starting some templates. Templates should include Goals and Success Criteria. HELP WANTED
* Sara Faatz is finishing up the [Events](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/events) readme and sponsorship request issue templates. Benjamin Howarth volunteered to help here. 
* Beth will add "event in a box" type of content for best practices on running online events and representing .NET Foundation. 
* Discussed how to accept new committee member nominations and activate our members with "jobs". HELP WANTED:
  + Input on proposal process (PRs requested)
  + Manage the monthly newsletter (watch repo, solicit content)
  + Review content amplification submissions
  + Build an events calendar  
* Cancelling Marketing committee report out to all members and will instead ask the ED to create a quarterly public meeting on the books where *all committees* present to the community.  @onovotny to discuss at next board meeting. 
* Went over Microsoft's .NET brand book and had very positive feedback. Almost ready to release to public.
