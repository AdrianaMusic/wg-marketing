### Notes
* Quick overview of Access Groups and Information Architecture for the Marketing Committee. The marketing team on GitHub is now the *committee members only*.
* Any member of the org can still participate in the [marketing team](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet-foundation/teams/marketing) public discussion **and we will take committee nominations there**. This is more for having only the *active* committee members and chair in a group that has maintainer access to the marketing related repos. 
* **Jon Galloway** nominated and accepted to join Marketing Committee and will take ownership of the production of the monthly newsletter.
* **Dee Dee Walsh** investigate events calendar technology. Will GitHub KanBan work?
* Discussed how to support Outreach team by advertising virtual meetups. Discussed automating YouTube playlist. 
* Beth walked through the repos and how to work with GitHub web interface for making pull requests and commenting. This is especially helpful for non-technical members. Helpful links:
