### .NET Foundation Survey Status
Beth Massi reviewed the new abridged mission statement with the committee. The Marketing Committee decided to test the new mission statement in the .NET Foundation survey. There was a discussion held around concerns with the lack of participation in the survey as well as the length. The Committee stated that they were planning to have a high level of marketing around the survey promoting big prizes for participation. The Committee will also promote the survey at the .NET Conference. The Committee reviewed the survey questions for redundancy and added suggested verbiage. 

### Marketing Committee Goals & FY21 Activities​ - Signoff

The Marketing Committee reviewed their FY2020 goals and priorities. The three high-level goals of the .NET Foundation Marketing Committee are: ​ 

* Increase membership in the .NET Foundation​ 
* Generate awareness of .NET open source and the .NET Foundation itself​ 
* Foster and grow an open community around .NET 

Beth Massi reviewed the [Marketing Committee goals PR](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-marketing/blob/master/goals.md). The Committee agreed that the Corporate Sponsorship goals will be transferred to the Corporate Sponsors Committee to implement. The Marketing Committee will partner with the Corporate Sponsor Committee to communicate their decisions to the community. 

### Corporate Sponsorship Meeting Update
Rodney Littles provided a Corporate Sponsors Committee update. The Committee decided to offer Corporate Memberships instead of Corporate Sponsorship tiers. The Membership structure would be Individual or Corporate membership. The Committee will have a membership drive in November and host a .NET Conference Spotlight. 

### Sponsorship & Promotions
#### Hackoberfest
Layla will drive the .NET Foundation participation in the Hackoberfest. The Marketing Committee will help to drive awareness via social media. Microsoft Azure plans to participate in the Hackoberfest with plans to amplify the .NET Foundation.

#### .NET Foundation Presence at .NET Conf
The .NET Conf newsletter communications will start on October 5th. There will be a total of four blasts prior to the date. The goal of .NET Foundations sponsorship in .NET Conf is to drive membership and newsletter signups. The Committee discussed the prizes that will be offered at the conference. The grand prize will be a $1,500 Microsoft Store gift card that was donated from US – Azure Sub. The Committee discussed the .NET Conference’s itinerary and session content. 

Jon Galloway provided an update on the Virtual Community Events and Tour. The Virtual Tour is similar to the normal User Group Meetups but held online. Jon briefly shared the new participation form created.
