### Channels "Year in Review" 

The Marketing Committee reviewed the 2020 communication channelsâ€™ performance stats, sentiment scores, and engagement results for the Foundation and .NET ecosystem. Overall, the results were positive. Based on the results, the Committee will recommend more engagement from the Board on social media, specifically Twitter. The Committee planned to request to spend $500.00 for Facebook promotions in 2021.
