## Marketing Goals - 2020
The three high-level goals of the .NET Foundation Marketing Committee are:
- Increase membership in the .NET Foundation
- Generate awareness of .NET open source and the .NET Foundation itself
- Foster and grow an open community around .NET

The committee has discussed the following activities we want to prioritize in 2020 that align to these goals.

- Organize our calendar (and keep it organized) with events/moments we can socialize
- Create impactful marketing content to carry open message
    - Organize Information Architecture on website & fill gaps (*in progress*)
    - Enable our members to get content/news and create/contribute to it by driving awareness of [newsletter contributions](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/newsletter) and [content submission & amplification](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/content) as well as contributing to our other social channels (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, etc.)
    - Arm our members with [.NET Foundation positioning & messaging](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/Marketing/ERk7JUich25Pmb1swksT4XoBcwrty2JQ4hVRNvW4q4AT_w?rtime=tRtrt96o10g) so we have one voice when we talk about the .NET Foundation
    - Get project-specific swag in the [Store](https://store.dotnetfoundation.org)
    - Create .NET brand book and release to community *(in progress)*
- Define [marketing activity proposal process](proposals.md) for our members to secure funds and drive initiatives *(in progress)*
